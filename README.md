Smart-Home-Control-App
======================

Developed a Cloud based Android application, MyHome, which supervised and managed the state of some simple elements of the home like lights and cameras.  The application showed the state of the devices to the user and allowed him to execute actions over them. These actions were passed to the central unit (Raspberry Pi) through the cloud database
